# Security Policy

## üîí Security Analysis Pipeline

This project includes automated security analysis using GitHub Actions to ensure code quality and identify potential vulnerabilities.

### Automated Security Checks

The security pipeline runs on:
- **Push to main/develop branches**
- **Pull requests**
- **Daily at 2 AM UTC**

### Security Tools Used

#### Python Security
- **Bandit** - Security linter for Python code
- **Safety** - Checks for known security vulnerabilities in dependencies
- **pip-audit** - Audits Python packages for known vulnerabilities

#### JavaScript Security
- **npm audit** - Checks for vulnerabilities in npm dependencies
- **ESLint Security Plugin** - Detects security anti-patterns in JavaScript

#### General Security
- **Trivy** - Comprehensive vulnerability scanner for filesystem and dependencies
- **Code Quality Tools** - Black, isort, flake8, pylint for Python; ESLint for JavaScript

### Security Configuration

#### Bandit Configuration (`.bandit`)
```ini
[bandit]
exclude_dirs = tests,venv,env,.git,__pycache__
skips = B101,B601
```

#### ESLint Security Rules (`.eslintrc.json`)
- Object injection detection
- Unsafe regex detection
- Eval usage detection
- Buffer security checks
- And more...

### Running Security Checks Locally

#### Python
```bash
# Install security tools
pip install bandit safety pip-audit

# Run security checks
bandit -r .
safety check
pip-audit
```

#### JavaScript
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run security checks
npm audit
npm run security
```

### Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit sensitive data** (API keys, passwords, tokens)
2. **Use environment variables** for configuration
3. **Keep dependencies updated** regularly
4. **Review security reports** from the pipeline
5. **Follow secure coding practices**

### Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please:
1. **DO NOT** create a public issue
2. Email security concerns to: ring.zero.sh@gmail.com
3. Include detailed information about the vulnerability
4. Allow time for response before public disclosure

### Security Updates

- Security patches are applied immediately
- Critical vulnerabilities are addressed within 24 hours
- Regular security audits are performed monthly
